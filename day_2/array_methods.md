**1. a.sort:** Sorts an array into either alphabetical order if the elements are strings, or ascending value order if the elements are numbers. This allows you to rearrange the order of the elements.

**1. a.each:** Allows you to loop through each element in the array and execute whatever code you put within the {} brackets. This will run the code between the {} once for each element.

**1. a.index:** Allows you to find the index number of a specific element. To do this, you put array.index("element_you_want") and it will return the index number. If there is no index number, it will return "nil."

**1. a.include?:** This tells you if any given object is present in the array you're asking about. If it's present, it will return "true," if not, it will return "false."

**1. a.collect:** This applies the block of code on all the items of the array and spits out a new array (it turns one array into another).

**1. a.first and a.last:** Returns the first/last element of an array. You're also able to return the first/last n elements by including how many you want included in parentheses after first/last (i.e. a.first(3) will return the first three elements of the array).

**1. a.shuffle:** Shows you a new array with the elements of the original one shuffled.
